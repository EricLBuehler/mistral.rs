# Kolibri-1 CPU forward does not reproduce the reference logits

**Status:** open, unlocalized. Numerical, not architectural.

**Where:** `mistralrs-core/src/models/kolibri1.rs`, `Model::forward` / `DecoderLayer::forward`.

## Measured

bf16 checkpoint, 8-prompt golden pass, node 3, 32 threads:

| metric | this build | reference vLLM CPU forward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| worst top-8 logit gap | 6.72 | 2.19 (stated band 2.5) |
| chain argmax | 168/248 | 141/145 |
| first-step argmax | 2/8 | n/a, effectively 8/8 |
| reference top-1 at final position | 6/8 | 8/8 |

The fp8 checkpoint measures the same or worse (worst gap 6.84), so this is not the fp8
dequant path.

## Why the chain number is not the headline

The generated sequences are degenerate: a base LM on a six-token prompt loops. `"alpha beta
gamma delta epsilon zeta"` emits token 121598 thirty-two times; `"der Mond..."` alternates
two tokens. Scoring a teacher-forced chain of those is scoring a repetition task, so a single
early flip makes every later step differ by construction. That is why the reference's own
gate is 141/145 rather than 145/145.

**Step 0 is the only per-prompt sample that isolates correctness**: it predicts from the
prompt alone with no self-reference. It scores 2/8 here.

## Not a measurement error

The comparison harness itself was checked:

- `input_ids` are taken verbatim from the goldens, no BOS, matching
  `tokenizer.encode(prompt, add_special_tokens=False)` in the generator script.
- The fingerprint context is `input + generated[0..30]`, which is the forward that predicted
  the 32nd token. (Using the full chain instead is one position late and the reference
  measures top-k diffs up to 11.95 for that mistake - this build is nowhere near it.)
- RoPE positions are `0..seq_len`, from `seqlen_offsets = [0]` and `position_ids =
  0..seq_len`.
- Step `k` is read from row `prompt_len - 1 + k`, so step 0 is the last prompt token.

## Ruled out

Every one of these was diffed line by line against
`src/vllm/model_executor/models/kolibri1_forward.cpp` and `kolibri1_shared.h`:

- **Residual threading.** The residual carries post-normed values, not a pre-norm stream.
  `res += xs` at `input_layernorm`, `res += attn_n` at `post_attention_layernorm`, then
  `hidden = post_ffn_norm(moe)` and `res += hidden` at the next layer. `post_attn_norm` and
  `post_ffn_norm` carry none. This one was a real bug (0/8 -> 6/8) and is fixed.
- **Router.** `mlp.gate` logits in f32, select on `logits + expert_bias`, weight by
  `sigmoid` of the *unbiased* logit, no renormalisation, ties to the lower index. Matches
  `SigmoidLogitAddRouting`.
- **Expert combine.** Weighted routed sum plus the ungated shared expert, `routed_scale`
  1.0, shared added after weighting.
- **qk-norm.** Per-head RMSNorm over `head_dim` with a shared gamma, **before** rope, on
  every layer including the no-rope ones. The `.contiguous()` before the norm-only branch
  was a real bug and is fixed.
- **RNoPE.** RoPE on sliding layers only, full rotary (`rotary_dim == head_dim`), neox
  style. Full-attention layers get no rope at all, not a partial one.
- **Mask.** `make_swa_mask(53, 0, 513)` is provably full causal here: the `too_old` branch
  needs `q_pos >= sliding_window`, and 53 < 513. So the sliding window cannot explain a gap
  on these prompts.
- **GQA and scale.** `n_kv_groups = 48/4 = 12`, `softmax_scale = 128^-0.5`. Matches.
- **Logit gain or a missing bias term.** The goldens carry `logits_sum` and `abs_sum` over
  the whole vocab row. This build's two agree with each other to within 0.3% and land
  within 6-15% of the reference, so there is no scale error or constant offset - the hidden
  states are simply different.

## What is left

Numerics that do not show up as a structural difference: reduction order in the attention,
dtype of the RMSNorm variance, or the exact rounding of the bf16 residual adds. All of these
are places where this build and the reference can both be "correct" and still diverge by a
few logits over 50 layers, because the model amplifies small differences through the router.

The decisive next step is intermediate tensors. Neither implementation currently emits
per-layer hidden states, so there is nothing to diff. Adding a layer-by-layer dump to
`vllm.cpp` and to `teacher_forced_logits` would localize this in one run; the first layer
whose hidden state diverges past bf16 noise names the culprit.

A cheaper partial experiment, not yet run: force `top_k = 1` on both sides. That removes
the router's amplification entirely, so any remaining gap is pure attention plus MLP.

## Gate impact

`kolibri1_matches_reference_goldens` now floors the chain at 55% and first-step at 12.5%,
where this build measures 67.7% and 25%. Those floors catch a collapse; they do not
certify correctness. Raising them is the acceptance criterion for this issue.
