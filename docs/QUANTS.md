## Using a GGUF quantized model
- Use the `gguf` (cli) / `GGUF` (Python) model selector
- Provide the GGUF file

```
cargo run --features cuda -- -i gguf -f my-gguf-file.gguf
```

## Using ISQ
See the [docs](ISQ.md)

```
cargo run --features cuda -- -i --isq 4 plain -m microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct
```

## Using a GPTQ quantized model
- Provide the model ID for the GPTQ model
- Mistral.rs will automatically detect and use GPTQ quantization for plain and vision models!
- The [Marlin](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/marlin) kernel will automatically be used for 4-bit and 8-bit.

```
cargo run --features cuda --release -- -i plain -m kaitchup/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gptq-4bit
```

You can create your own GPTQ model using [`scripts/convert_to_gptq.py`][../scripts/convert_to_gptq.py]:
```
pip install gptqmodel transformers datasets

python3 scripts/convert_to_gptq.py --src path/to/model --dst output/model/path --bits 4
```

## Using a MLX prequantized model (on Metal)
- Provide the model ID for the MLX prequantized model
- Mistral.rs will automatically detect and use quantization for plain and vision models!
- Specialized kernels will be used to accelerate inference!

```
cargo run --features ... --release -- -i plain -m mlx-community/Llama-3.8-1B-8bit
```
