# KBD Generic Constraint Configuration

This file defines **project-generic** constraint rules for KBD. Each project
should override or extend these in `.kbd-orchestrator/constraints.md` at the
repo root. This file documents the format and provides sensible defaults.

---

## How to Use

1. Copy this file to `.kbd-orchestrator/constraints.md` in your project root
2. Customize `blocking` and `warning` constraints for your stack
3. KBD and all executing tools will read this file during verification

---

## Blocking Constraints (prevent archiving until resolved)

These are universal to all projects:

```yaml
constraints:
  - id: no-console-log-in-commits
    severity: blocking
    description: "No console.log statements in committed TypeScript/JavaScript"
    check: "grep -r 'console\\.log' src/ --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' --include='*.js'"

  - id: no-any-type
    severity: blocking
    description: "No `any` type usage in TypeScript source"
    check: "grep -rn ': any' src/ --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx'"

  - id: no-hardcoded-secrets
    severity: blocking
    description: "No hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords in source"
    check: "grep -rn 'sk-\\|api_key\\|API_KEY\\|secret.*=.*[\"\\x27][A-Za-z0-9]' src/"

  - id: build-passes
    severity: blocking
    description: "Project build must pass without errors"
    command: "<see .kbd-orchestrator/project.json build_health_command>"

  - id: no-unused-imports
    severity: blocking
    description: "No unused imports (varies by language)"
    note: "Enforce via lint command in project.json"
```

---

## Warning Constraints (acknowledge before archiving)

```yaml
  - id: tests-for-new-features
    severity: warning
    description: "Tests exist for all new features added in this change"

  - id: no-lint-warnings
    severity: warning
    description: "No lint warnings at default severity"
    command: "<see .kbd-orchestrator/project.json lint_command>"

  - id: no-stub-comments
    severity: warning
    description: "No TODO/FIXME/STUB/HACK comments in committed code"
    check: "grep -rn 'TODO\\|FIXME\\|STUB\\|HACK' src/"

  - id: accessibility-basics
    severity: warning
    description: "New UI components have aria-label or semantic HTML"
    note: "Manual review required"
```

---

## Workflow Triggers

These run after each change iteration:

```yaml
workflow_triggers:
  - event: on_iteration_complete
    action:
      type: command
      target: "<build_health_command from project.json>"

  - event: on_change_complete
    action:
      type: command
      target: "<test_command from project.json>"

  - event: on_refinement_complete
    action:
      type: command
      target: "git add -A && git commit -m 'kbd: refine <change-id>'"
```

---

## Project-Specific Overrides

Add project-specific constraints below after copying to `.kbd-orchestrator/constraints.md`:

```yaml
# Project: <project-name>
# Added: <date>
constraints:
  # Add your project-specific blocking constraints here
  # Examples:
  # - id: tenant-id-on-all-queries
  #   severity: blocking
  #   description: "All Supabase queries must include .eq('tenant_id', tenantId)"
```
